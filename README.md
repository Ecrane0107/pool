My Pool game project, written entirely in python! This still isn't the final project, but the main features are there.

Requirements:
  1) [Pygame](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame), [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy) modules
  2) Python 2.7

Here's a screenshot from the game:
