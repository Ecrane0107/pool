My gravity simulation program. The program uses newtonian gravity model to simulate how planets would attract.

Features:
 - Planets (or dots on the screen) attract based on their distance from eachother and their mass
 - Created planets by clicking and holding your mouse. The longer you hold your mouse the bigger the created star will be. You can also move your mouse from the staring position to add an inital force on the planet.
 
 P.S.: the program doesn't have a realistic scale, meaning that gravity to mass and other ratios are changed from real ones. That is the case because real life gravity is really weak and most object in the universe are light minutes or years afar, which would make for very boring simulation.
